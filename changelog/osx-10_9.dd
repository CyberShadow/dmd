macOS deployment target was increased to 10.9

The compiler has been updated to use 10.9 and link with `libc++` on OSX.
This is due the shared `libstdc++` library from older versions of macOS
having compatibility issues with the headers included in a modern XCode.

The minimum required version of running the compiler is now Mac OS X Mavericks (10.9).
